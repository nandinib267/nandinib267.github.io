          I coded this project to take trajectory data of groups of Zebrafish <i>(Danio rerio)</i> generated by Deeplabcut and, for each frame, identify which sector of the circular tank the fish are in. Further, the program filtered out data for all frames except those in which all fish were in the same sector. 

          Useful for identifying shoaling patterns in zebrafish.

          To further investigate shoaling patterns of Zebrafish <i>(Danio rerio)</i>, I wrote a program that calculates inter-individual distance of groups of Zebrafish and filters the frames according to a user-set threshold. 

          For example, if the threshold set is of 2 bodylengths, then any frame in which the fish were more than 2 bodylengths away from each other was filtered out. This left only the relevant frames remaining in the dataset and allowed for investigation of shoaling patterns

            Working with Abhishek Singh, a PhD. student in Prof. Bittu's lab on his project on Group Rationality in Zebrafish. I arranged for primary research materials and ran and recorded over 30 trials with zebrafish. Also ran analysis of the videos to glean trends and patterns and handled glitches and recalibrated the experiment design using data collected from pilot trials.

            I also coded group tracking and filtering algorithms from scratch to further understand shoal patterns in zebrafish (see above!). Presently working on drafting a publishable paper.

            Presented relevant papers to the team during lab meetings.

            Working under Prof. Madhavi Maganti in data collection for her ongoing project on Cross-Linguistic and Developmental Differences in Narrative macrostructure using MAIN (Multilingual Assessment Instrument for Narratives) in Hindi-English Bilingual children. 

            Held interviews with children between the ages of 5-6 and 7-8 in both, Hindi and English. 

            Coordinated with the parents of 20 students from St. Xaviers School, Noida for the process of data collection. This included reaching out to ask for permission, getting consent forms signed, coordinating online to find convenient times to hold the trials, running the trials, and other formalities. 

            Collaborated with a team to transcribe all the trials in the proper format for further scoring.
